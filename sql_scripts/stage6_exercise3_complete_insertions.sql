First, free education eliminates socioeconomic barriers that prevent talented individuals from reaching their potential, ensuring that merit rather than financial means determines educational access. This creates a more equitable society where opportunities are distributed based on ability and effort rather than economic privilege. Second, free education serves as a crucial driver of economic growth and innovation, as an educated workforce is essential for competing in the global knowledge economy. The long-term benefits of an educated population far outweigh the initial costs through increased productivity, reduced crime rates, and enhanced social cohesion. However, some argue that free education could lead to decreased quality and value perception, as people might not appreciate what they don''t pay for directly. While this concern has merit, the solution lies in maintaining rigorous academic standards and creating a culture that values education intrinsically. In conclusion, free education is not merely a social good but an economic imperative that benefits society as a whole.", "evaluation_criteria": {"argument_structure": 30, "logical_flow": 25, "academic_expressions": 25, "critical_thinking": 20}, "type": "academic_debate"}', 1, 'Education Policy', 'C2'),

First, social media platforms have been shown to contribute to mental health issues, particularly among young people, through mechanisms like social comparison, cyberbullying, and addictive design patterns that exploit psychological vulnerabilities. Second, the spread of misinformation and echo chambers on these platforms has demonstrably harmed democratic processes and social cohesion, making some form of regulatory oversight necessary for the public good. However, some argue that any government regulation of social media constitutes censorship and violates fundamental freedoms of expression. While this concern is valid, the distinction between reasonable regulation and censorship is crucial—we can implement safeguards against harmful content while preserving legitimate free speech.

Second, space exploration addresses fundamental questions about our place in the universe and provides insurance against existential risks, such as asteroid impacts or climate change, that could threaten human civilization. The knowledge gained from space exploration expands our understanding of physics, biology, and planetary science in ways that benefit all of humanity. However, some argue that the enormous costs of space exploration could be better spent addressing immediate problems on Earth, such as poverty, healthcare, and education.

Second, AI development affects global economic and social systems in ways that transcend national boundaries, requiring international cooperation to ensure equitable benefits and prevent harmful concentration of power. The development of AI governance frameworks can actually enhance innovation by creating clear ethical boundaries and safety standards that guide responsible development. However, some argue that international regulation would stifle innovation and give authoritarian regimes control over technological development, potentially creating competitive disadvantages for democratic nations.

First, traditional schools provide crucial social development opportunities that are fundamental to human growth, including peer interaction, conflict resolution, and the development of emotional intelligence—skills that are increasingly valuable in our interconnected world. Second, the structured environment of traditional schools teaches important life skills such as discipline, time management, and working within systems, which are essential for success in most professional environments. The physical presence of teachers and peers creates accountability and motivation that online learning often lacks. However, some argue that traditional schools are too rigid and fail to adapt to individual learning needs, while digital platforms offer unprecedented personalization and flexibility. While this criticism has validity, the solution lies in integrating technology into traditional settings rather than replacing them entirely.

Second, migration promotes cultural diversity and innovation, as diverse perspectives and experiences enhance creativity and problem-solving in workplaces and communities. The humanitarian aspect of providing opportunities for people seeking better lives also aligns with fundamental human rights principles. However, some argue that open borders could overwhelm infrastructure, strain social services, and create cultural tensions that undermine social cohesion. While these concerns are legitimate, they can be addressed through proper planning, gradual implementation, and investment in integration programs.

Second, the skills required for professional sports are extremely rare and have short career windows, while essential workers provide sustained value throughout longer careers, suggesting that compensation should reflect both rarity and duration of contribution. However, some argue that market forces should determine compensation entirely, as they efficiently allocate resources based on demand and supply.
